### Continuous Implicit Authentication Modeling with combined kNN-SVM confidence-based model for smartphone applications. The results of this research show that the kNN-SVM model presented here can detect if a non-authorized user uses the smartphone in about 2.44 swipes. The dataset being used in this research is a public dataset created via a commercial application called "BrainRun". This dataset has 975 different user's gestures which was used in order to train and test this model.
